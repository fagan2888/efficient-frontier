# Markowitz Efficient Frontier

This software uses the Markowitz algorithm to compute the Efficient Frontier of Mean-Variance efficient portfolios. By default, it produces plots (in `SVG` format) of the efficient frontier and the composition of efficient portfolios. Alternatively, it can also produce plain text output giving the same information. 

The inputs required are: the means, variances and covariances (of correlations) of the security returns.
